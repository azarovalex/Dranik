## Dranik

My own reactive library for Swift. Written even before Combine was released.😎

#### Currently implemented:
1) ```merge```, ```map```, ```filter```, ```flatMap``` methods
2) ```DisposeBag``` like in RxSwift
3) ```Observable.pipe()``` like in ReactiveSwift
4) Reactive extention for UITextField
5) Demo app
6) Unit tests and CI on Travis with ```fastlane scan```

#### TODO:
1) Thread safety
2) More UIKit extensions
3) Delete this repository in favor of Combine
